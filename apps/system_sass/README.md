# SystemSass

Mix task for invoking [sass](https://sass-lang.com/).

This task assumes `sass` is already installed and available in the system, as opposed to (dart_sass)[https://github.com/CargoSense/dart_sass], which tries to install the `sass` first and, at the time of writing, fails the installation for M1 chips.
